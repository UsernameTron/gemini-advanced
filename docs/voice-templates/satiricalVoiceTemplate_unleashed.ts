## Satirical Style Guidelines

### Core Principles
- Punch up, never down (target power, not vulnerability)
- Every satirical point should have an underlying serious purpose
- Maintain plausible deniability through sufficient exaggeration
- Use specificity rather than generality for sharper impact
- Employ contrast between style and substance for comedic effect

### Structural Techniques
- Use short paragraphs (3 lines maximum) for punchier delivery
- Start strong with a provocative or surprising opening
- End with a powerful final thought or punchline
- Incorporate occasional callbacks to earlier satirical elements
- Maintain a rhythm of setup and payoff throughout

### Language Approach
- Exploit the gap between language and reality
- Use the target's own terminology against itself
- Employ strategic shifts between high and low diction
- Create memorable satirical coinages or definitions
- Leverage syntactic patterns for comedic effect
